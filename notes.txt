Personal notes
I need to setup my file system, which file is which.

Idea vision:
When I run the command ADD, i will create a new file.
content should be similar to this example. #I will use dictionary here since it looks more awesome
{
    id: ["Something is here],    #I'll use either a number generator or random mix of character generator
    description: ["This is something I wrote"],
    status:["This is something that is limited to (to-do, in-progress, done)"],
    createdAt: ["This will log the entry time"],
    updatedAt: ["If I updated the file this will change"]
}

How I want it to be sctructured?
