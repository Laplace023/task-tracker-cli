Task tracker cli project from: https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

*Task Cli*

This is my first project and all I can say is it's an awesome pile of "mess" that somewhat works.

**Requirements**
Have python3 installed

**Installation/Setup**
- Clone the repo on your local
- Open the terminal on the main.py diretory and make it executable by running `chmod +x main.py`
- After this you can either run the code on the directory or adding the path when running it outside or...
- Create an alias task-cli='<file with full directory>' you can save this to your ~/.bashrc if you're planning to keep it.
- then run `task-cli --help` for instructions.
